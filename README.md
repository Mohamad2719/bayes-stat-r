Coursera Course Projects

This course described Bayesian statistics, in which one's inferences about parameters or hypotheses are updated as evidence accumulates. I learned to use Bayesâ€™ rule to transform prior probabilities into posterior probabilities, and I was introduced to the underlying theory and perspective of the Bayesian paradigm. Additionally, the course introduced credible regions, Bayesian comparisons of means and proportions, Bayesian regression and inference using multiple models, and discussion of Bayesian prediction.
